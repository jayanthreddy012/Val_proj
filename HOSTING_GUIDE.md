## 📱 QUICK TIP: Custom Domain (Optional)

- Buy a domain from Namecheap, Google Domains, or similar (~$10/year)
- Connect it in your hosting provider's settings

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Both files must be in the same folder** (the HTML and GIF need to be together)
- The HTML file must be named `index.html` for the page to load automatically
- Keep the GIF filename as `celebration_dance.gif` (or update the HTML if you change it)
